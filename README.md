Amazon Fashion Recommendation System

This project utilizes the Amazon Fashion public dataset to build a product recommendation system for clothing items. The dataset contains product metadata, reviews, ratings, and images across categories like Men's Fashion, Women's Fashion, Kid's Fashion, etc.

I implemented content-based algorithms to generate personalized product recommendations. The collaborative filter analyzes historical user data to find customers with similar interests and recommend relevant products. The content-based system recommends similar items based on product descriptions, images, and other metadata.

Key techniques used include:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing 
- Feature extraction from product text and images.
- Cosine similarity matrix for content-based recommendations
- Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score

This recommendation system provides a great example of how filtering algorithms can be applied to real e-commerce data. The code and notebooks here demonstrate the end-to-end pipeline for building and evaluating a recommender system. Feel free to use this as a template for your own recommendation projects!
